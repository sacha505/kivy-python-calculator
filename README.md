# kivy-python-calculator
Python calculator made with GUI library kivy

I'm making a pastel coloured calculator inspired by the built-in windows calculator.

Some helpful documentation:
* https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html
* https://colorhunt.co/ (good colour schemes here for your projects)
