# kivy-python-calculator
Python calculator made with GUI library kivy

I'm using online guides to create the initial app and then learning from that to make it look more like a pastel version of the windows calculator.

Some helpful documentation:

https://colorhunt.co/ (good colour schemes here for your projects)
